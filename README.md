# Nuclear Symmetry Energy Measurement from Vortex Oscillations in Pulsar Glitches

## Status: Investigation Phase

This repository contains analysis history of a study of pulsar vortex oscillations for constraining
nuclear symmetry energy (L₀). The methodology is currently under review due to
potential circular dependencies in the calibration procedure.

### Issue Identified (November 30, 2025)

The effective vortex length (L_eff) parameters may not be independently constrained,
leading to potential circularity:
- Calibration: α fitted using assumed L_eff = 0.6R for G1 glitch
- Application: Other L_eff values derived using calibrated α

### Current Investigation

Examining whether vortex bending mode theory can provide independent predictions
for L_eff(n) from first principles. Investigation includes:
- Eigenvalue problem for pinned vortex segments
- Crustal structure constraints on mode wavelengths
- Alternative observables (damping, energetics)

### Publications

- Original paper retracted from Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17537461) on
  November 30, 2025 pending resolution of methodological concerns
- ResearchGate record removed

**Possible Outcomes:**
1. Theory validates L_eff values → Measurement valid, refine and publish
2. No independent constraints found → Circularity confirmed, stay retracted
3. Partial constraints → Reformulate with appropriate uncertainty
